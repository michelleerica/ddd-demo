Stub for bff for local development

Expose the url of both this bff stub and front end so that you can view the page on a tablet. Be sure to start the stub with the correct front end url or there would be cors configuration problems.

Start the app:
```
FRONT_END_URL=http://localhost:3000 PORT=8080 node standalone.js
```
